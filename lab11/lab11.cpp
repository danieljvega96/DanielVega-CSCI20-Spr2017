/*  This is a guessing game in which the user is given 10 trys to guess a randomly
generated number by the computer. First, the computer will randomly pick one 
number between 1 and 1000, and will show the phrase "Guess a number between 1 and 1000",
after this, the user will be allowed to input a number between 1 and 1000. If 
the user enters a number lower than the randomly generated number, the phrase 
"higher" will be displayed. If the user  enters a number higher than the randomly
generated number, the phrase "lower" will be displayed. For every incorrect guess,
the user gets a point subtracted from their score and the phrase "Lower/Higher" 
will be displayed, depending on the user's guess, followed by (however many 
points are left) "more trys". After the user's points are reduced to zero,
the phrase "Sorry, you lost, the number was" followed by the randomly generated
number. If the user guesses the correct number, the phrase "congratulations! That
was the correct number!" Will be displayed, followed by the phrase "Your points
are" followed by the amount of points left.
